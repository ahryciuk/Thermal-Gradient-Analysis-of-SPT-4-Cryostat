# Thermal-Gradient-Analysis-of-SPT-4-Cryostat
Assessment of thermal gradient across conductive pathways from Pulse Tube Cryo-cooler to key internal subassemblies

## My Role:
- performed both analytic and finite element analyses to evaluate thermal gradients across the 50 Kelvin and 4 Kelvin subassemblies
- developed Python code bases to perform analytic calculations with varying design geometry and material properties

## Notes and Assumptions:
- material properties


## Summary of Results:
